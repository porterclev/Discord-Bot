# Discord-Bot

## Description:
I'm creating a discord bot that links a website to an embed. The embed will interact with the website and, if everything goes right, make a playable game. 

## Permissions
Full administration w/messaging turned on

## Files
### ./commands
###### All commands typed in text channels are stored there (prefix is ".")

### ./components
###### Functions that need to be called for connecting commands together

### ./command-handler.js
###### Automatically calls functions in "./commands" (don't change)

### ./index.js 
###### Initializes command-handler (don't change)

## Initializing Bot
### add .env 
###### Insert "TOKEN = {insert token here}"

### add discord.js
###### Currently runs on discord.js v14.7.1
